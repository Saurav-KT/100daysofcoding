### 1.Find the duplicate number in an Array

<i>Easy </i>
<hr>

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1,n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

<b>Constraints:</b>

<ul>
<li>1 <= n <= 105</li>
<li>nums.length == n + 1</li>
<li>1 <= nums[i] <= n</li>
</ul>
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
